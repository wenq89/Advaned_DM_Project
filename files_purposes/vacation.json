I am short-waisted and broad shouldered, so it worked out okay for me, but I did size up to get as much fabric coverage as possible.

Typically I wear a size 8 or a 10 if it runs small or has no hip room. I had read this dress ran short, so I ordered the 10 & 12 anticipating I'd want more fabric.

I am not a huge fan of maxi dresses as they typically run short on my and I'm not always thrilled with the style in general.

The dress doesn't have any give but I wouldn't say it 'runs large' like some of the other reviews. I'm typically a 4 (sometimes a 6) and thought it was a touch loose in the waist. Next, the dress came really wrinkly. It's evident that its the material and not really RTRs fault. I used a mini steamer on it and the wrinkles came out immediately.\n\nI got loads of compliments on this number. At 5 foot almost 11 this dress just touched the top of my feet. I enjoyed that I wasn't tripping on it and people could see my sandals. The slip under the top layer of the dress was not too short (a first for me) and the pink is a real bright coral color. I would buy this dress in a heart beat if it was still summer as the price is actually not too shabby. No pockets on this number though ladies and a sticky bra or petals is a must.

I wear a solid size 6 in most dresses, and the 6 here fit perfectly. I'm a bit busty (34D), and while the dress was a bit tight around there and the shoulders, overall the fit was great. Another great thing about this dress is that you really don't need to wear Spanx or anything underneath it - the body is straight but not tight, which is really nice. The dress IS short, so I'm not sure if I'd wear it to a formal event/wedding. For a night out in Vegas, though, it's perfection. Highly recommend for a fun night out.

My only cautions:  1) I ordered the 40 (US size 2, I think) and it was too big in the shoulders/arms/chest, so I had to keep pulling it up in front and checking to cover my bra on the sides and under my arms. It wasn't very fitted on the bottom, either. I don't know if the 38 (US 0) would've fit better, but I thought Missoni would run small so I didn't get a backup size. I'd order a size down if you're short and/or small chested.\n2) I couldn't tell the front from the back of the dress, so I had to look at pictures on RTR to see it on the model. Maybe I'm just a novice, or maybe I was having a moment of idiocy, but the lining inside the knit overlay is cut the same way front vs. back and the tag is sewn into a side seam.

This dress was SO cute. I would rent this dress again and again!! It's so pretty, that I only wore earrings/bracelets for accessories. Didn't need a necklace at all because of the silver shimmer.\n\nPROs: \n- The pattern looks good in person with just the right amount of shimmer and is very flattering (I'm curvy, so this doesn't make you look bigger than you are like some prints).\n- The fit is great. The length is just right at mid-thigh (I'm in my late 20s, so I don't like micro-minis).\n- Dress has decent lining. I didn't need to wear a bra and it's thick enough that the dress lays really nicely top to bottom.\n\nCON:\n- Don't really have much.
